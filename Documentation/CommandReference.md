## üéÆ **Relationship Level System**

Your system uses these relationship levels based on points:

| Points Range | Level | Description |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| 0-19 | **Stranger** | Just met, minimal connection |
| 20-39 | **Acquaintance** | Basic familiarity, casual friendship |
| 40-59 | **Friend** | Good relationship, mutual trust |
| 60-79 | **Close Friend** | Strong bond, deep trust |
| 80-100 | **Soulmate** | Maximum relationship level |

## üí° **Best Practices**

### **Character Name Matching**
```csharp
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - matches RelationshipManager exactly
@addlove CharacterName:brownsugar Points:10

# ‚ùå WRONG - case mismatch
@addlove CharacterName:BrownSugar Points:10

# ‚ùå WRONG - parameter name error  
@addlove characterName:brownsugar points:10
```

### **Point Economy Balance**
```csharp
# ‚úÖ GOOD - Gradual progression
@addlove CharacterName:matcha Points:5   # Small positive interaction
@addlove CharacterName:matcha Points:10  # Medium positive choice
@addlove CharacterName:matcha Points:15  # Major story moment

# ‚ùå AVOID - Too extreme
@addlove CharacterName:matcha Points:50  # Jumps too many levels at once
```

### **Story Pacing**
```csharp
# ‚úÖ GOOD - Regular relationship building
Scene 1: @addlove CharacterName:tapioca Points:8
Scene 3: @addlove CharacterName:tapioca Points:6  
Scene 5: @addlove CharacterName:tapioca Points:12

# Check progress periodically
@showstats
```

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**Character Not Found:**
```
‚ùå Problem: "Character 'Matcha' not found in relationships"
‚úÖ Solution: Use exact name from RelationshipManager: "matcha"
```

**Parameter Not Assigned:**
```
‚ùå Problem: "CharacterName parameter not assigned"
‚úÖ Solution: Always include CharacterName parameter
```

**RelationshipManager Missing:**
```
‚ùå Problem: "RelationshipManager.Instance is NULL!"
‚úÖ Solution: Ensure RelationshipManager component is in scene
```

### **Testing Commands**
```csharp
# Test your setup
@addlove CharacterName:brownsugar Points:25
@showstats

# Should show in console:
# "üíï brownsugar: +25 points = 25/100 (Acquaintance)"
# "=== üíï RELATIONSHIP STATS üíï ==="
```
